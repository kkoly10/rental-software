# Vertical end-to-end walkthroughs

Tracks the operator + customer journey for each of the 6 day-one
verticals so we can catch and fix the gaps before any of them go to
a real paying operator.

## Driving setup

- **Environment**: live production (`https://korent.app` and subdomains).
- **Test orgs**: each vertical gets its own org named
  `[E2E TEST] <Vertical>` so cleanup is easy and prod operators don't
  see them.
- **Test email**: `e2e+<vertical>@<dead-domain>` so the real
  verification + welcome + receipt emails land somewhere disposable.
- **Stripe**: walks stop **before** the deposit charge unless the
  operator has Stripe test-mode keys configured for the prod org —
  the goal is end-to-end coverage of code paths, not real money.
- **Playwright**: `tests/e2e/<vertical>.spec.ts` drives the browser.
  Each spec is independent + can run solo.

## Findings log

Anything not "✅ pass" gets a short entry here with the bug + a
proposed fix.

### Stage 1 — Marketing → Signup

**Inflatable** (`https://korent.app/inflatable-rental-software`) — ✅ pass.
- Marketing page loads, title matches `/Inflatable/i`.
- Signup CTA visible + clicks through to `/signup`.
- Signup form renders all required fields (`email`, `password`,
  `full_name`, `terms_accepted`).
- (Did not actually submit — operator account already exists.)

### Stage 2 — Login → dashboard

**Inflatable** (`komlankouhiko@icloud.com` / `Couranr LLC`) — ✅ pass.
- `/login` → submit → lands on `/dashboard`.
- Sidebar shows all 4 groups (Ops, Catalog, Finance, Admin) with
  the post-#304 fix in place. Deliveries item visible (would have
  been hidden pre-fix for non-inflatable verticals).
- Header shows the org name "Couranr LLC".

### Stage 3 — Store setup

**Inflatable** — ⚠️ pass with 3 observations to verify.

The walkthrough confirms `/dashboard/products` renders 3 existing
products on this mature account, and `/dashboard/products/new`
renders the form. **Three things to verify next:**

1. **Category mis-assignment.** Product *"20x20 Party Tent"* is
   filed under category **"Bounce Houses"**. Operator-side mistake
   or a real bug in category resolution? Likely the former since
   the org's `business_type = 'inflatable'` and the operator
   created the product. But it's the kind of thing a multi-vertical
   add (#298) would have to handle correctly — if this org later
   adds the tents vertical via the settings card, "20x20 Party
   Tent" should be reassignable, not silently re-filed.

2. **Product named "Scheduled delivery"** — looks like leftover
   test data, not a real product name. Not a bug, just cleanup.

3. **`<ContextHelpBanner>` showing "Add new product"** on
   `/dashboard/products` despite the account having 3 products.
   Verify the banner is gated on `productsCount === 0`, not just
   "user hasn't dismissed it." If the dismiss is the only gate,
   that's a UX bug — mature accounts shouldn't see new-operator
   onboarding nudges.

### Stage 4 — Customer browse

(not yet driven; spec needs the operator's public storefront URL —
look it up from `organizations.slug` and run a separate anonymous
walk against `<slug>.korent.app`.)

### Stage 5 — Customer checkout + deposit

Blocked across all verticals — Stripe is not yet configured for
the prod org. Re-run this stage once Stripe test-mode keys are
wired so we can verify deposit charges + webhook delivery without
real money.
